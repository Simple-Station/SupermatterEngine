Supermatter Engine is a game engine primarily being developed for [Space Station 14](https://github.com/Simple-Station/Einstein-Engines).

Use the [content repo](https://github.com/Simple-Station/Einstein-Engines) for actual development, even if you're modifying the engine itself.

## Building

This repository is the **engine** part of SS14. It's an engine SS14 servers are built on. As such, it does not start on its own: it needs the [content repo](https://github.com/Simple-Station/Einstein-Engines). Think of SME as BYOND in the context of Space Station 13.
